Introduction
------------

Tinytium is an initramfs generator based on Gentoo’s Portage. It features a
small set of custom utilities, while relying on BusyBox for most of its
features, which are:

•  Command-line-configurable recovery mode, which allows either local login or
   remote (SSH) access. When recovery mode is entered, a minimalist init system
   is able to set up a network connection (using DHCP if configured to do so)
   and starts an SSH daemon; syslogd is also available;

•  Support for resuming an hibernated system, automatically detecting and
   loading an hibernated image;

•  Support for UUID= and LABEL= methods for specifying partitions/volumes.



Name
----

Tinytium is a portmanteau of “tiny” and “initium” (Latin for “beginning”),
respectively its goal and its purpose (as in “beginning of the boot process”).
